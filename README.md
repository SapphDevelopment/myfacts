# myFacts NPM Package

This is an NPM package that provides random facts in various categories. The package includes the following categories:

## Categories

- Random
- Discord
- Google
- OpenAI
- Software
- Urlcut
- Youtube

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```ssh
npm install myfacts
```

## Usage

To use the package, first import the `getFact` function from the package:

```js
// TypeScript: import getFact from "myfacts";
const getFact = require("myfacts");
```

Then, call the `getFact` function with a category parameter to get a random fact from that category:

```js
const fact = getFact("Google");
console.log(fact);
```

This will log a random fact from the Google category to the console. You can replace "Google" with "Software" or "Discord" to get a random fact from those categories instead. More categories listed under the category list

You can also optionally pass an index parameter to `getFact` to get a specific fact from the array:

```js
const fact = getFact("Google", 2);
console.log(fact);
```

This will log the third fact (index 2) from the Google category to the console.
